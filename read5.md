# adding images
## to add an imge into the page you need to use an:
1. `<img>` element
2. src,and this tells the browser where it can find the imge file
3. alt,this provides a text description of the imge which describes the imge if ypu cannot see it.
### so it should be like this :
* `<img src="the link" alt ="the description"`
