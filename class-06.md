# the hardest things to write code is 
1.Naming things.
2.Learning a new technology
3.Debugging
* "Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain."
## WHAT IS AN OBJECT ?
*Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would
recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names
* If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property
* If a function is part of an object, it is called a method
*An object cannot have two keys with the same name. This is because keys are used to access their corresponding values
* The value of a property can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or even another object. The value of a method is always a function.
### Document Object Model
* it is mean how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
* The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules.
