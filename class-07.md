# Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. 
* When the function is called, the data inside these parameters are stored inside.
*  Storing data within properties ensures any newly created object can access that data later.
## when you try to build tour own domain model you should lnow these tips :
1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
# what's tables 
* A table represents informaition in agrid format.
## basic tables structure 
* `<table>` 
* this elements is used to create a table 
* `<tr>`
* the "tr" stands for table row and it is followed by one or more `<td>` 
* `<td>`
* each call of tables is represented using `<td>` element  
* `<th>` 
* the `<th>` element is used just like the `<td>` but its purpose is to represents the hedaing 
### long tables
* there are three elemets that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows
* `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`  
# Functions, Methods, and Objects
* Whenever you have a value that is a string, you can use the properties and methods of the String object on that value
* Each character in a string is automatically given a number, called an index number. Index numbers always start at zero and not one (just like for items in an array). 
## In JavaScript there are six data types: Five of them are described as simple (or primitive) data types. The sixth is the object (and is referred to as a complex data type). 
1. String
2.Number
3. Boolean
4. Undefine
5. Nul
6.0bject
